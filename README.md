Evolution of deaths by covid19 since the first death (Evolução do número de mortos por Covid19 desde o primeiro morto)

There are two main folders, namely, 

(1) Data-Analysis which contains the code to compute two gifs showing the evolution of of deaths by Covid19 since the first death

and

(2) Simulations which offers an algorithm to simulate the evolution of an epidemic in a clustered population. For more details, see https://www.ime.usp.br/~patriota/Covid19.html

The following packages are required to run both codes:

install.packages(c('gplot2', 'plotly', 'gganimate', 'magick'))
